# U-Net-based-Catheter-Segmentation

In this project, cardiac catheters are segmented using U-Net based deep learning architectures from X-Ray images obtained through
a radiograph video of the chest area. Original images along with their respective binary masks are used to train a U-Net model to segment the catheter
and then the model is tested using different accuracy metrics conventionally used in deep learning.
